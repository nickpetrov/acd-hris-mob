            <p>Working in aged care is not like other jobs. It is not like working in an office environment in the city. Being an aged care professional means staying on top of your knowledge because if you do not, people might die.</p>
            <p>There are a wide variety of education and training opportunities for people who work in aged care. It might be the next step qualification, moving from the Certificate III in Aged Care up to the Certificate IV in Aged Care, or it might be something completely different such as learning some IT or language skills. At ACDN we believe a mix of these various options is best.</p>
            <p>Depending upon your role, your current qualification and where in Australia you live, there are a variety of courses and government funding options. Answer the short questions below for an indication of what you might be eligible for.</p>
